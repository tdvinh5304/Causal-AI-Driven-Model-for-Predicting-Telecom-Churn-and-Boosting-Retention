# Causal-AI-Driven-Model-for-Predicting-Telecom-Churn-and-Boosting-Retention
## 📚 Overview
This repository presents an enhanced customer churn prediction model tailored for the telecommunications industry. By integrating **Causal AI** with advanced machine learning techniques, the project goes beyond traditional correlation-based analysis to uncover the true causes of customer churn.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🔍 Combines **Causal AI** with **XGBoost**, **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**, and **Deep Neural Networks (DNN)**
- 📌 Identifies major churn drivers: contract types, service usage levels, and payment methods
- 📈 Provides high prediction accuracy with interpretable, actionable insights
- 🎯 Supports proactive strategies to reduce churn and improve retention

## 🧠 Why Causal AI?
Traditional models often rely on correlation, which may mislead decision-making. **Causal AI** distinguishes between *correlation* and *causation*, helping telecom providers understand **why** customers leave—enabling smarter, data-driven strategies.

## 📊 Model Performance
The integration of Causal AI with machine learning:
- Increases predictive precision
- Enhances interpretability
- Delivers actionable recommendations

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 📦 Scikit-learn  
- 🌲 XGBoost  
- 🤖 TensorFlow / Keras  
- 🧪 DoWhy / EconML (for causal inference)
